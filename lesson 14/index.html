      Var declarations, wherever they occur, are processed before 
      any code is executed. This is called hoisting, and is discussed further 
      below. The scope of a variable declared with var is its current execution
      context, which is either the enclosing function or, for variables declared
      outside any function, global. If you re-declare a JavaScript variable, 
      it will not lose its value. Assigning a value to an undeclared 
      variable implicitly creates it as a global variable 
      (it becomes a property of the global object) 
      when the assignment is executed.

    <p class="tabset-body" data-body-id ="2">
      Let allows you to declare variables that are limited to a scope of a block
      statement, or expression on which it is used, unlike the var keyword, 
      which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function 
      regardless of block scope. The other difference between var and let is 
      that the latter is initialized to value only when parser evaluates it 
      (see below).Just like const the let does not create properties of 
      the window object when declared globally (in the top-most scope).
    </p>
    <p class="tabset-body" data-body-id ="3">
      This declaration creates a constant whose scope can be either global or
      local to the block in which it is declared. Global constants do not 
      become properties of the window object, unlike var variables. 
      An initializer for a constant is required; that is, you must specify 
      its value in the same statement in which it's declared 
      (which makes sense, given that it can't be changed later).
      The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. 
      It does not mean the value it holds is immutable, 
      just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned.
